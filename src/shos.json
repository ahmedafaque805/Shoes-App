Together with NASA, we ran experiments in zero-gravity to micro-tune Boost midsoles to perform better on earth. And because all the innovation is pointless without thought for the planet, the shoes stand as part of our commitment to help end plastic waste."

        "dis":"When the adidas Ultraboost debuted back in 2015, it had an impact that spilled beyond the world of running. For this version of the shoes, we retooled the design on a 3D-printed midsole. The denser parts of the lattice provide more support, and the parts that are open feel more cushioned. These shoes don't just look like the future. They feel like it, too."

The adidas Primeknit upper has the same weave featured on the original design dropped back in 2015. Boost provides incredible energy return, whether you wear them while running or as an everyday pair."
